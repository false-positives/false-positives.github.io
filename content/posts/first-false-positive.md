### why false positives?

well, "lesswrong" was already taken and this makes for a good alternative, I believe. 
usually, false positives are those mistakes that ML models make overconfidently. which is kinda appropriate, ngl.
but it can also be understood as hot takes, ideas that seem revelatory at first but collapse under scrutiny. also quite approapriate.
all in all, its another way of saying that everything that you see on here "might be wrong, but it's interesting".


### what is false positives?

technically, a blog. practically, that requires blog posts, and I don't have a great track record of consistent writing. last time I tried to write at least one post per month, I only got 6 posts by the end of the year.


### what's it about?

nothing in particular. i just wanted a place where i could write about stuff that is interesting to me, so that i can actually improve my writing skill. with the all AI frenzy going on, I do think this might become increasingly important.

i intend to write about the research that i am currently doing in semi technical but not-so-formal-as-in-a-paper kind of way. if there is one thing i actually don't like about papers is that msot of them do not really show how they came about the idea, what they tried and did not work and what conclusions were drawn from that. the end results are important, no doubts about that, but for me the process is more insightful. it's basically the same reason why i like reasoning LLMs. not because of the improved answers, but because the reasoning part helps a lot with getting an intuition about the problem.

i will also try to write about books that i read or films that i see. recipes that i like and coffee beans that i enjoy. maybe i'll also post some of the pictures i take, now that i got an analogue camera to play with.
